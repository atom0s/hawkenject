# hawkenject

hawkenject is an injected hook for the [defunct] Unreal Engine 3 game, Hawken. The goal of this project is to reimplement the stripped dedicated server features and functionality that is missing in the latest available retail client.

Hawken was originally showcased at PAX EAST 2012 which included a playable demo of the game. This client (built in late 2011) included UE3 dedicated server functionality. However, later releases of the actual retail client have parts of that dedicated server functionality removed from the executable. This project aims to restore the stripped features and functionality.

Currently, this project is intended for use with the client version: `1.5.3.142579`
